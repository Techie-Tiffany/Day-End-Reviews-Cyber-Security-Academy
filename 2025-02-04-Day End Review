Yesterday we attended and Lunch and learn with Cybersecurity Leaders at Clark Atlanta University 
This panel discussion centers around entering and growing within the cybersecurity field, with a strong emphasis on practical strategies, mindset, certifications, real-world experience, and leveraging AI.

Key Takeaways:
1. Breaking Into the Field:
Getting your first cybersecurity job is challenging, but persistence, networking, and being proactive are essential.

Leverage what makes you unique: speak a different language, have a military background, or industry-specific experience (e.g., nursing in healthcare cybersecurity).

Certifications like CompTIA Security+, Network+, CEH, and CISSP are helpful, especially for government roles, but hands-on projects and self-initiated learning can carry equal weight.

Tools like TryHackMe, YouTube walkthroughs, and creating content on your journey (e.g., blogs, videos) help showcase your skills.

2. Importance of Certifications vs. Experience:
Certifications build credibility, especially when starting out.

Experience and value creation matter more over time. Once you're in, it's about your impact, not just your resume.

A four-year degree is helpful, especially for leadership roles, but not required to be successful in cybersecurity.
