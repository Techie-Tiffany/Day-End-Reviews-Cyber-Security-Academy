I refer to this as wellness, I selected this first because I fell ill after having my son. Diagnosed with RA, Sjgrones, Fibromyalgia,Costochondritis, and Gut dysbiosis. I was a healthy young woman before having my son, 0 pre-existing disorders. For years doctors were waiting to pretty much diagnose me with Lupus, the same disease that took my mother at the young age of 49. I was determined to live, not just survive. I learned a lot about how I could take my wellness into overdrive and reduce systemic inflammation which is the root cause of many diseases. You will always see me eating my cruciferous vegetables in smoothies, salads or juices. Living this way helps me maintain low autoimmune disease numbers (ANA) and low inflammation. I no longer associate with any of these conditions.
