# <u>Meeting Paul Farley</u> 
# Fitness- 
I refer to this as wellness, I selected this first because I fell ill after having my son. Diagnosed with RA, Sjgrones, Fibromyalgia,Costochondritis, and Gut dysbiosis. I was a healthy young woman before having my son, 0 pre-existing disorders. For years doctors were waiting to pretty much diagnose me with Lupus, the same disease that took my mother at the young age of 49. I was determined to live, not just survive. I learned a lot about how I could take my wellness into overdrive and reduce systemic inflammation which is the root cause of many diseases. You will always see me eating my cruciferous vegetables in smoothies, salads or juices. Living this way helps me maintain low autoimmune disease numbers (ANA) and low inflammation. I no longer associate with any of these conditions. 


# Family - Everything I do is for my family. My son is on the Autism spectrum and has a rare genetic disease. He and my husband are the primary family that I have been blessed with, their health, wellbeing, happiness etc. is a top priority for me. 

# Knowledge - Throughout my career in sales, I’ve often been positioned as the "face" of a company—focused on bringing in business while only scratching the surface of the complex services and products I was selling. However, I’ve always had a deep curiosity about how things work, and I no longer wish to limit myself. Expanding my technical expertise and education not only sharpens my mind but also positions me as a true subject matter expert in my field. Knowledge is power, and I thrive on continuous learning—whether it’s in technology, wellness, autism research, or product innovation. I’m passionate about diving deeper, understanding the details, and using that knowledge to drive meaningful impact. 

# Wealth & Financial Independence - Building wealth is a key focus for me, not just for personal success, but for the stability and future of my family. Without an extended support system, I recognize the importance of financial independence in achieving my goals and ensuring my special needs son receives the educational and developmental support he deserves. I want to provide him with the best resources, including a tutor and a nanny, so that no aspect of his growth falls through the cracks—especially during the times when I am fully committed to advancing my career and building a legacy. My ultimate goal is to create a life where I can support him without limitations, attain financial freedom, and retire young while making a meaningful impact.
