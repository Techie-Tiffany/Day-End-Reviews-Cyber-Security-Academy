3 Positive Things about me
1. I am able to take complex technical topics and break them down into digestable information to non-technical counterparts 
2. I  like being prepared and hold myself to a high standard 
3. I am always analyzing how things work and how they can be improved

3 areas for improvement 
1. I can be overly cautious at times
2. I tend to overanalyze things
3. I have a hard time delegating sometimes because I like things a certain way 
We also created a Personal Plan for the career/ position we see ourselves pursuing
