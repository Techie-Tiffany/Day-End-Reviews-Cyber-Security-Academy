# Day-End Review: March 7, 2025
## Key Learnings
We summarized the week by playing a game called **Spaceteam** that required for a team to work together, communicate in a high stakes enviornment to get to differnt levels of a game.
# Communication is Critical – We had to give clear, concise instructions while actively listening to each other. This mirrors possible ***real-world teamwork*** scenarios
# Collaboration & Trust Matter – Success depends on every person doing their part, reinforcing the importance of *shared goals and mutual reliance.*
# Problem-Solving Under Pressure – The game introduces unexpected challenges (malfunctions, scrambled controls), requiring teams to stay calm, adapt, and think quickly.
# Team Dynamics & Leadership Emerge Naturally – Even without assigned roles, teams develop strategies, assign informal leadership, and improve coordination over time.
# Ultimately another team came to join our team, we worked well together and quickly identified each persons strengths and weaknesses which helped the team excel to higher levels
