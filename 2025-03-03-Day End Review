# Day-End Review: March 3, 2025
## Key Learnings
- *Campus Tour* John re-stated the purpose and vision for the City of Refuge and showcased the different areas on campus. I felt extremely blessed for the opportunity to be a part of this program. It struck me that my late mother grew up in this very area. She attended what she would call "Brown High" back in the 70s. She had such pride about being a majorette at Brown High. 
That thought reaffirmed my place here. I am always adding goals for myself and thought I truly hope to be able to write the City of Refuge a check one day to give back to this community that my mother once loved so much.
It would be such a full circle moment for me.

- Learned about different **processor architectures** (AMD, Intel, ARM).

- Explored **GitHub repository management** and Markdown formatting.

- Discussed **Windows security management tools** like `lusrmgr.msc`.



## Challenges Faced

- I am new to GitHun. I wanted to ensure that I keep this enviornment very **organized** so I needed to figure out the best way to set this Repository Up.

- Needed to understand how to **create Markdown files**.



## Next Steps...

- Practice using **Windows command-line tools** in RUN.

- Improve GitHub workflow (commits, pull requests). Find a good YT Video on it
